This repository contains three Machine Learning Projects.The coding is done using Python on a Jupyter Notebook

First Project is on the use of Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality reduction. IRIS Dataset is used for analysis.

The Second Project is on the use of Support Vector Machine Classifier.Different Kernels are used and comparison made.

The third Project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing/classification.Fashion Mnist DataSet is used 
for analysis in this project
