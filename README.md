This repository contains 22 Machine Learning and deep learning Projects. The coding is done using Python on a Jupyter Notebook. The datasets used are available on the Kaggle site.
The first project uses principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. IRIS Dataset is used for analysis.
The Second Project involves using a Support Vector Machine Classifier. Different Kernels are used, and comparisons are made.
The third Project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing/classification. Fashion Mnist DataSet is used 
for analysis in this project
The fifth project demonstrates data visualization plots available in the Seaborn package. 
The sixth project is on the application of PCA and Gaussian mixture models
Projects 7 and 8 demonstrate the application of linear regression. 
Project 9 shows the application of logistic regression on the iris dataset
Projects 10 and 11 show the application of Support Vector Machines
Project 14 is on the application of K means clustering
Projects 15 and 16 demonstrate the application of DecisionTreeClassifier
Projects 17 and 18 demonstrate the application of neural networks for mobile prices and Boston Houses datasets.
Project 20 is on applying Convolutional Neural Networks on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Projects 21 and 22 involve using Deep Learning to classify images on the CIFAR dataset and analyze sentiment on the IMDB customer review dataset.
